# React Router Advanced

This project demonstrates **advanced routing techniques in React** using **React Router v6**. It includes nested routes, dynamic routing, and protected routes.

## Features

- **Nested Routes:**  
  The `Profile` component contains nested sub-routes: `ProfileDetails` and `ProfileSettings`.

- **Dynamic Routes:**  
  Dynamic route `/profile/:id` to display different user profiles based on the `id` parameter.

- **Protected Routes:**  
  Only authenticated users can access the `Profile` route. Users are redirected to the `Login` page if unauthenticated.

- **Navigation:**  
  Links and buttons for navigating between Home, Profile, and Login pages.
