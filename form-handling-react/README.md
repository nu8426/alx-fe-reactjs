# Form Handling in React

This project demonstrates:

1. Controlled components for form handling in React
2. Formik integration with Yup validation

Components:

- **RegistrationForm.jsx** – uses React `useState` to manage input values and basic empty-field validation.
- **formikForm.jsx** – uses Formik with Yup for advanced form handling and validation.
