# React Todo List App

This is a simple **Todo List application** built with **React**.  
The app allows users to:

- View a list of initial todos
- Add new todos
- Toggle todos between completed and not completed
- Delete todos

The project also includes **unit tests** using **Jest** and **React Testing Library** to ensure the component works correctly.
